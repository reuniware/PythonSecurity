Project about ip rotation with TOR

Install tor browser + add path to tor.exe in environment variable Path (for user or system)

Install chromedriver

Modify code (for chromedriver path, and strings, eg. for Captcha detection)

Start Tor Browser

Run the script

You will have IP rotation and will be able to generate traffic for eg. a Youtube Video ;)
