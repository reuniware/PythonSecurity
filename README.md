Scripts to perform various security analysis

For now I have coded a simple but fast enough port scanner.
Use it carefully as it tries to connect in TCP to the remote ports from 1 to 65535.
It works with IP address as input but also DNS name (eg. google.com).

Update 2019/11/27 :
Today I have added Python scripts to sniff DNS requests :)
I have also added a basic TCP sniffer !
